Electron based wrapper for node's GraphicsMagick module.

We aim to represent all gm features with a Bootstrap based form. A simplifed canvas and toolbox is scheduled for RC2.

## Getting started
First download and install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) or [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/). In Mac OS X, you can simply use [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) and do:

    brew install imagemagick;
    brew install graphicsmagick;

If you want WebP support with ImageMagick, you must add the WebP option:

    brew install imagemagick --with-webp
